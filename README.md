# eatmymail

Finds and deletes duplicates of mails in maildirs.

Duplicate detection is based on Message-IDs and hashsums of content
parts of each mail.

Beware: This is very much untested and very likely to eat your mails!
Before you consider using this, make sure to have a backup and be
prepared to restore it!

Also, don't blame me if it swallows your inbox :-]
